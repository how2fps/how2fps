- 👋 Hi, I’m @how2fps
- 👀 I love theorycrafting in card games, surprisingly I also somewhat enjoy web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, and then I'll move on to typescript, and azure (maybe aws).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun small projects.
- 📫 How to reach me.. idk is it possible to be reached here? :D
